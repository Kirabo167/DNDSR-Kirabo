# Unreleased: independent solver executables (2026-10-09)

- Restore the upstream Euler model targets and split ACM/NCFV Euler into
  independent 2D/3D executables. Keep `ACM`, variable-density ACM variants and
  the existing Euler state/Cantera tools.
- Name node-centred executables `ncfv_euler2D` / `ncfv_euler3D`; group cases
  and schemas under `cases/{euler,acm,ncfv_euler}/{2D,3D}` with model subfolders.
- Reuse common libraries while separating ACM/NCFV dimension instantiations;
  add `all_euler`, `all_acm`, `all_ncfv_euler`, `all_solvers` and family presets.
- Add native `--check-config`, executable/model/state-size checks and the
  `solver_config` CTest group. Euler reads existing adjacent defaults rather
  than overwriting them; missing defaults are built in memory.
- Refresh schemas, configuration defaults and CLI examples. Migrate 11 retired
  NCFV `Roe_M2` cases to `Roe`; archived comparisons require recomputation.
- Local validation passed 29 CPU module tests, 15 Cantera Euler tests,
  142 configuration checks, 11 mismatch checks and nine two-rank short runs.
  This is not a complete engineering-case convergence or upstream field-solution
  equivalence claim; pre-existing Wilcox/WBAP/periodic-mesh differences remain.

See [the migration and upstream comparison guide](docs/guides/solver_split_zh.md)
for the pinned reference, exact target/case mapping and test limits.

# Kirabo167 fork: v0.3.1 integration

The fork integrated the official v0.3.1 commit into its existing v0.2.1-based
development line at merge commit `783243c`. In addition to the upstream
features below, the integration:

- preserves and adapts ACM, ACMVariable, and NCFV to the v0.3.1 mesh-incidence
  and Gas APIs;
- handles periodic self-face coupling consistently in ACM Block-Jacobi and
  LU-SGS implicit operators;
- makes the Wilcox k-omega kernel consume the configured `productionLimit`;
- refreshes contributor/build/package metadata, adds reproducible CPU,
  reactive, schema, Python, CUDA, and CI presets, and pins the header-only
  dependency bundle with SHA-256 verification;
- makes committed configuration schemas describe the full Cantera-enabled
  feature set while preserving underscore-prefixed StateValue metadata and
  validating legacy examples;
- repairs the Python wheel/install layout, removes stale bundled MPI/C++
  runtimes, and documents that current wheels are local, MPI-ABI-specific
  artifacts pending third-party redistribution review;
- verifies the baseline matrix (102/102 CTest entries: 100 C++/MPI plus two
  Python suite entries), Python bindings/tests (49 passed, 1 skipped), and the
  full Cantera-enabled C++/MPI matrix (108/108 CTest entries, including the
  focused 8/8 reactive subset);
- records the feature delta, migration requirements, external test meshes,
  and CPU/CUDA scope in
  [`docs/guides/v0.3.1_new_features_zh.md`](docs/guides/v0.3.1_new_features_zh.md).

Subsequent fork commits retain the official v0.3.1 feature baseline but use a
PEP 440 post-release version such as `0.3.1.postN+g<commit>` rather than
claiming the unmodified upstream release tag.

# 🚀 DNDSR v0.3.1 — Reactive-State Repair, RANS Controls & Shared Skills

5 commits · 31 files changed · 1,412 insertions · 569 deletions

This patch release hardens reactive-flow initialization and chemistry source evaluation, makes RANS model safety limits configurable, adds a periodic wave-mesh generator for Fourier studies, and shares repository-local skills between OpenCode and Codex.

---

## 🔥 Reactive-Flow Robustness

- **Cell-mean species repair**: reactive species densities are projected back into a valid simplex after initialization and restart loading, using the same conservative correction policy as fixed-increment solution updates.
- **Physical-state validation**: repaired cell means now report recoverable errors for non-finite states, invalid density, non-positive sensible internal energy, or temperature below the mechanism floor.
- **Chemistry source-state repair**: reconstructed quadrature-point compositions are repaired in a temporary buffer before chemical source evaluation, while convective and diffusive transported species remain unprojected.
- **MPI evaluator coverage**: added focused reactive cell-mean repair tests and registered them for the repository's multi-rank CTest matrix.

---

## 🌪️ Configurable RANS Hard Limits

- **Spalart-Allmaras production cap**: introduced `SAConfig.productionLimit`; the default increases from 100 to `1e5` to recover ordinary-SA convergence, while the Orion case explicitly retains 100.
- **Two-equation model controls**: exposed the existing production and turbulent-viscosity limits for Wilcox k-omega, SST, and realizable k-epsilon models without changing their historical defaults.
- **End-to-end configuration wiring**: concrete RANS config objects now flow through viscosity, source, and viscous-flux kernels and are represented in all nine Euler JSON schemas.
- **Focused regression coverage**: expanded RANS tests for defaults, JSON round-trips, and the physical effect of the SA production limit.

---

## 📐 Fourier Meshes & Case Records

- **Periodic wave-mesh generator**: added `scripts/generate_8x8_wave_cgns.py`, parameterized by cell count, domain length, and origin so h/2h/4h meshes can share an aligned physical core.
- **Configuration refresh**: recorded selected high-speed-cylinder and CRM configuration updates.
- **Legacy plotting cleanup**: removed the superseded MATLAB and Tecplot helpers under `data/outUnsteady/`.

---

## 🛠️ Shared Agent Skills

- **Codex discovery**: `.codex/skills` now points to `.opencode/skills`, keeping one maintained repository-local skill source for both agent environments.
- **Codex-compatible metadata**: removed OpenCode-only frontmatter fields from the Cantera C++ and PyVista post-processing skills.
- **Canonical PyVista renderer**: the post-processing skill now links to `workspace/detonation2d/render_detonation.py` instead of carrying a stale duplicate.

# 🚀 DNDSR v0.2.1 — Geom Module Quality Release

15 commits · 183 files changed

Bugfix release completing the Geom module clang-tidy sanitation and polishing infrastructure.

---

## 🧹 Geom Module Clang-Tidy Sanitation (12 passes)

From baseline to zero warnings across the Geom/ module. Carry-forward of the DNDS sanitation strategy.

### Notable Geom transformations

- **Quadrature constants** moved into `detail::` namespace (`src/Geom/Quadratures/*.hpp`)
- **Mesh buffers** (`src/Geom/Mesh/`) converted from `T arr[N]` to `std::array<T,N>` with `.data()` at C-API boundaries
- **C-style casts** eliminated from `Mesh_Plts.cpp` — all `(T*)(ptr)` → `reinterpret_cast<T*>(ptr)`
- **Reserved identifier** `__[A-Z]` → `_detail_*` (class members) or `detail::` namespace (free functions)
- **`CoordPairDOF` default constructor** added (missing from earlier DNDS pass — fixed after build failure)

---

## 🔧 DNDS & Solver Fixups

- **`UnInit` sentinel completeness** — replaced remaining `= 0` / `= NAN` init values across DNDS and Geom with canonical `UnInitReal`, `UnInitIndex`, `UnInitRowsize` sentinels
- **Added `UnInitMPIInt` / `UnInitMPIAint`** to `src/DNDS/MPI.hpp` (required for CUDA TUs — MPI types not visible through `Defines.hpp`)
- **`Linear.hpp` audit** — `<math.h>` → `<cmath>`, `NAN` → `UnInitReal`

---

## ⚙️ Infrastructure

- **CI CJK fonts** — installed in CI and added to Marp CSS font stack for Chinese presentation rendering
- **VTKHDF test artifact cleanup** — `test_basic_eulerP.py` now writes test output to `tempfile.mkdtemp` instead of leaking files to the project root; `*.vtkhdf` / `*.vtkhdf.series` added to `.gitignore`
- **`run_clang_tidy.py` improvements** — `--list` flag (deduped site listing), `--fix-parallel` flag (Phase 1 parallel diag + Phase 2 serial fix), `SITE_RE` regex, deduped summary counts
- **`.clang-tidy`** — 16 project-specific disables with rationale; `narrowing-conversions` added

155 commits · 385 files changed · 56,227 insertions · 10,506 deletions

📖 **Documentation**: [cfdlab-thu.github.io/DNDSR](https://cfdlab-thu.github.io/DNDSR/)

## 🔗 Geometry DSL & Reorder Framework

The centerpiece of this release is a complete declarative adjacency graph engine that replaces imperative element-traversal loops with composable DAG operations — the foundation for mesh reordering, ghost exchange, and multi-layer connectivity.

### 🌳 MeshConnectivity DAG DSL (`src/Geom/Mesh/MeshConnectivity.hpp`, 1,497 lines)

A layered framework of adjacency relations between entity strata (cells ↔ faces ↔ edges ↔ nodes) with three composable operations:

- **`Inverse`** — cone (A→B) → support (B→A), computing upward adjacencies from downward topology
- **`Compose`** — A→B + B→C → A→C, chaining adjacencies across strata
- **`ComposeFiltered`** — filtered composition with on-the-fly predicate matching (including PBI containment for periodic boundaries)

Periodic bits (PBI) are stored only on cones whose target depth is 0 (nodes), tracking how node coordinates transform under periodicity. The DSL is templated on adjacency row-size for optimal memory use.

### 👻 Ghost Chain Evaluator (`src/Geom/Mesh/MeshConnectivity_Ghost.cpp`, 583 lines)

Hybrid BFS evaluator for ghost cell construction supporting:
- Five ghost chain types: cell2node, face2node, cell2cell through faces/edges/nodes
- `evaluateGhostTree` with declarative chain definitions
- Multi-layer ghost cells (`BuildGhostPrimary(nGhostLayers)`) — arbitrary depth
- Standalone unit tests with analytical verification on synthetic grids

### 🔀 Reorder Framework (`src/Geom/Mesh/ReorderPlan.hpp`, 267 lines + `Mesh_Reorder.cpp`, 877 lines)

Two-layer architecture for distributed entity reordering:
- **`ReorderRegistry`** — dynamic callback container holding adjacency remapping, relocation, and companion-relocate callbacks
- **`ReorderPlan`** — standalone computed transfers + lookups, with forward/backward index mapping
- **`buildReorderRegistry`** — automatic callback population from mesh state
- **`ReorderEntities`** — complete reorder on real meshes: pull-set collection, son entity reattachment, cell2cellFace vertical face handling

### 🔄 PermutationTransfer (`src/DNDS/PermutationTransfer.hpp`, 363 lines)

Reusable distributed/local row permutation utility encapsulating the common pattern: given a partition assignment or forward map for a set of entities, compute new global indices and transfer array rows to target ranks. Supports both MPI push (distributed) and in-place permutation (local) paths.

### 🏷️ AdjPairTracked Infrastructure (`src/Geom/Mesh/AdjIndexInfo.hpp`, 355 lines)

Per-adjacency index state tracking with encapsulated `AdjIndexInfo` fields:
- `markGlobal()` / `markLocal()` / `toLocal()` / `toGlobal()` / `bootstrapToLocal()` API
- `wireTargetMapping()` for ghost mapping routing
- `fillRegistry()` for automatic reorder callback registration
- Device views for CUDA offloading
- Full contract coverage in state-checked wrapper contract
- Pybind11 exports for Python introspection

### 📐 Mesh Helpers & Pipeline

- **`mesh_helpers`** — unified C++ API for read/prepare/build workflows, migrated from inline Euler solver boilerplate
- **`Python Geom utils`** — `read_mesh()`, `prepare_mesh()`, `build_bnd_mesh()`, `build_fv()` with CGNS/H5 read modes, elevation, bisection
- **Distributed mesh read** — `ReadDistributed_Redistribute` and `ReorderLocalCells` migrated to declarative framework
- **Synthetic mesh builders** — 2D tiled synthetic grids with analytical ghost formulas for rigorous connectivity testing

### 🧬 Element Generation Tools

- **CGNS topology data** — 1-based reference tables mapping CGNS face/node numbering to DNDSR conventions
- **Element diagrams** — automated 3D edge-group visualization with tuned viewing angles
- **Traits emitter** — `traits_emitter.py` codegen for element shape function traits from CGNS data, including edge topology
- **Prism18** shape functions expanded with edge group metadata

---

## 🧹 Code Quality Crusade

A foundational rework of the DNDS/ core layer achieving near-zero warning diagnostics.

### DNDS/ Clang-Tidy Sanitation (26 passes)

| Readability | `readability-simplify-boolean-expr` | Simplify boolean logic |
| Readability | `readability-named-parameter` | Annotate unused parameters |
| Readability | `readability-redundant-casting` | Drop unnecessary casts |

### 🎨 clang-format Consistency

Unified `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format` configs with Python drivers (`run_clang_tidy.py`, `run_clang_format.py`) supporting:
- `--fix` serialization for incremental correction
- Per-check histogram reporting
- Cross-module consistent configuration

Formatting applied across all DNDS/ headers and drifted Euler/Solver files.

### 🔧 Move Semantics & Memory Safety

- Proper move constructors/assignment operators for all array types
- `ArrayPair::clone` latent bug fix (incorrect resource sharing)
- `rvalue-ref-parameter-not-moved` fix in `ArrayDofDeviceView`
- Default-disable LTO in pybind11 builds to prevent link-time ODR violations
- Stop bundling `libstdc++`/`libmpi` into `dndsr_external` shared library

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Infrastructure

A full GitHub Actions pipeline replacing the previous stub-only workflow.

### 🏭 CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, 375 lines)

- **Runner selection**: GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`) or self-hosted Docker containers via a lightweight "resolve" job → single "build-and-test" job (no wasted matrix entries)
- **Trigger system**: `/ci-run` and `/ci-run-self-hosted` PR comments with write-access gating — no label management needed
- **3-layer caching**: restore/save split for externals (submodule SHA keys) and Python venv, with runtime sentinel checking for cache prefix mismatches
- **ccache** with cross-branch cache persistence on both runner types
- **h5py/mpi4py** source builds to avoid HDF5 version conflicts with cfd_externals
- **pytest-timeout** integration for hung MPI test prevention
- **MPI oversubscribe** enforcement for GitHub runners
- **Cache save on failure** — ccache persists even when build or tests fail
- **OMP thread pinning** (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` by default)

### 📖 Docs Deployment (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

Manual Pages deployment workflow with 3-layer caching for incremental Sphinx/Doxygen builds.

### 📊 CTest Summary

| **Geom** | `SyntheticMeshBuilders.hpp` | 940 | 2D tiled synthetic grids with analytical formulas |
| **DNDS** | `test_PermutationTransfer.cpp` | 376 | Distributed + local row permutation |
| **CFV** | `test_Reconstruction.cpp` | +351 | Expanded reconstruction coverage |

### 🔁 Test Infrastructure

- **doctest per-case CTest registration** — individual test case names in CTest output for pinpointed failure identification
- **`OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`** default for all C++ unit tests (configurable via `DNDS_TEST_OMP_THREADS`)
- **`DNDS_TEST_NP_LIST`** environment variable for MPI test ranks at configure time
- **`ctest_summary.py`** — aggregated doctest statistics across all categories

### 🐍 Python Tests

- **Geom** — `test_basic_geom.py` expanded (+110 lines) for new mesh helpers, distributed read, elevation with bisection
- **Euler** — `test_restart_redistribute.py` updated for mesh helper migration
- **EulerP** — `test_basic_eulerP.py` & `test_solver.py` CUDA guard updates

## 🔧 Developer Tooling

### 🧹 Static Analysis

- **`run_clang_tidy.py`** (559 lines) — per-check histogram, `--fix` serialization, module-scoped iteration
- **`run_clang_format.py`** (341 lines) — multi-module formatting with cross-module config uniformity
- **Unified `.clang-tidy`** (178 lines) — single source of truth for CLI and IDE (clangd discovers automatically)
- **Unified `.clang-format`** — consistent brace/indent/wrap rules across all modules
- **CI gate** — advisory (not build-blocking); clang-tidy runs produce reports, not errors

### 🧬 Element Code Generation

- `traits_emitter.py` (227 lines) — generates C++ element trait source from CGNS topology data
- `element_data.py` (552 lines) — comprehensive CGNS element reference: node numbering, face maps, topology
- `gen_diagrams.py` (478 lines) — 3D element visualization with PyVista, structured edge groups, tuned viewing angles

### 🐳 Pre-commit

- Updated hook scripts for clang-tidy/format integration
- Stub generation script for pybind11 modules
- Deprecated legacy shell scripts, replaced with Python drivers

## 🐛 Notable Bug Fixes

### 🧵 Mesh State Tracking

- **Per-adjacency state conditions** now enforced alongside group state guards — every site that sets `adjXState` also calls `markGlobal()`/`markLocal()` on governed adjacencies
- **Target mapping re-wiring** — after `ReorderLocalCells` ghost rebuilds, stale per-adjacency target mappings now correctly re-wired
- **`MatchFaceBoundary`** — `face2bnd` now correctly converted to global before ghost pull
- **Ghost tree evaluation** — scratch-pull gating separated from output collection, fixing stale data reads
- **`faceElemInfo`** — re-pulled after `MatchBoundariesToFaces` in DSL path

### 🔁 Interpolate & Periodic BCs

- **Multi-parent handling** — fix edge and face interpolation on 2×2×2 periodic hex meshes where an entity has multiple periodic parents
- **Double-periodic BCs** — `InterpolateFace` wrong face identity on doubly-periodic boundary configurations (fixed in earlier range, carried forward)

### 🔒 Build & Runtime

- **`BuildSerialOut`** side-effects — `pLGlobalMapping` no longer silently modified during serial export
- **MPI `mpicxx.h`** — deprecated header inclusion prevented across all MPI implementations (not just MPICH)
- **`libstdc++`/`libmpi` bundling** — removed from `dndsr_external` shared library, eliminating version conflicts
- **Pybind11 LTO** — disabled by default to prevent link-time ODR violations
- **Python MPI init** — switched to `mpi4py` initialization to avoid OpenMPI singleton hang
- **Stub generation** — MPI init skipped during stub generation to prevent double-free crash in MPI_Finalize
- **`Python_EXECUTABLE`** — passed to CMake configure on self-hosted runners where `python3` ≠ target venv

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- **CTest registration** — uses `Python_EXECUTABLE -m pytest` to avoid PATH-dependent python resolution
- **MPI oversubscribe** — `--oversubscribe` always passed on GitHub runners for `np > cores` scenarios
- **Euler config** — `euler_default_config.json` removed from test dependency chain (was gitignored, causing CI failures)

### ⚡ Performance & Correctness

- **Array move semantics** — proper move constructors/assignments prevent accidental copies in template instantiation paths
- **`ArrayPair::clone`** — fix latent bug where clone incorrectly shared internal resources
- **SA-DES `lLES` clamping** — bypass for pure RANS mode, resolving hybridization edge case; `SAVersion` option added
- **Merge range audit** — comprehensive fixes for range 13b4e7b..HEAD (Euler SA-DES, state tracking, documentation)
